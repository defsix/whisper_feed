/**
 * Tapping a source narrows the feed to it, and the way back is obvious.
 *
 * The idea arrived as "make it act like the search" — same bar, same back
 * arrow and X — and the chrome is exactly right. Reusing the *search* for it
 * would not have been, for two reasons that are invisible until they bite:
 *
 *  - `matchesSearch` compares substrings across the headline, the feed title
 *    and the body, so "slate" also returns "tran*slate*", "*slate*d for
 *    release" and every article that merely mentions Slate;
 *  - a search deliberately widens the query from FEED_WINDOW to every article
 *    ever stored, which is the cost a day of work had just removed from the
 *    feed.
 *
 * So the bar is the search bar's sibling and the filter is not the search.
