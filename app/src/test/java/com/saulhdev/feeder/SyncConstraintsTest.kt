 * When the app is allowed to fetch on its own.
 *
 * Two independent switches, Wi-Fi only and charging only, rather than one
 * "when to sync" list. The list was the first plan and it was short of an
 * entry: it could not say *unlimited data, but not on battery*. All four
 * combinations of these two are real, which is when switches beat a list —
 * unlike `articleOpenMode`, where two booleans encoded three modes and one
 * combination meant nothing at all.
 *
 * Both halves of this are the kind that go on compiling after being undone,
 * so both are read here.
