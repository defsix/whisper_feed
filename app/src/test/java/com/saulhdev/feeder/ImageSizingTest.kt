/**
 * Every image this app loads is bounded before it is decoded.
 *
 * Coil takes a decode size from whichever bound it can find — the layout
 * constraints, or an explicit size on the request — and falls back to the
 * picture's own dimensions when it finds neither. A feed photograph published
 * at 4000px, decoded whole to be drawn a few hundred wide, costs around fifty
 * times the memory it needs, on the one code path that runs while the reader
 * is scrolling.
 *
 * Nothing in the ImageLoader prevents this, though a comment there used to
 * claim otherwise. The bounds are in the composables, which means the
 * invariant is spread across five files and any new image is one modifier away
 * from breaking it — silently, because the picture looks identical either way
 * and only the allocation figures differ.
 *
 * So it is checked here instead: every image call site in the app, and the
 * bound it relies on.
