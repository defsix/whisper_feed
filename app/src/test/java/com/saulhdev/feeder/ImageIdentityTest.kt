/**
 * Pictures are fetched as something a server will serve.
 *
 * The image loader was built with the network guards and nothing else, so
 * every picture went out as `okhttp/5.5.0` with no Accept header. HttpIdentity
 * already said why that matters — "a consent page, a stripped variant, a
 * challenge, or a flat 403" — and already defined two identities. Neither was
 * applied here, which is the same omission the network guards had before they
 * were given one name and one test.
 *
 * What it asks for is a measurement, not a preference. A trace of a real
 * scroll timed one AVIF image at 87.9ms against 29.1ms for the JPEGs beside
 * it, because Android decodes AVIF through a software AV1 codec. A
 * content-negotiating CDN serves the best format the client claims, so
 * claiming AVIF is asking for the slow one.
