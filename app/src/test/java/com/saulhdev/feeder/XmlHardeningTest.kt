/**
 * The ampersand repair does not claim to be a security measure.
 *
 * It was called `xmlSafe`, which read as though it hardened the parse. It does
 * not: it escapes an `&` that is not already starting an entity, and nothing
 * else — no DOCTYPE handling, no external entities, no expansion limits. A
 * name that claims safety is worse than no guard at all, because the next
 * person to add a parser reaches for it and stops looking.
 *
 * The hardening it implied now exists where it belongs, on the parser. The
 * packs it reads ship inside the APK, so nothing hostile can be in them and it
 * changes nothing today — the point is that the helper is one import away from
 * being pointed at a file somebody sent, and at that moment the defaults are
 * what would apply.
