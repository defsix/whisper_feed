/**
 * An article's cached text cannot be written outside the app's files.
 *
 * The file name is built by interpolating the article's id, and nothing at
 * that line said the id was safe to interpolate. Every id is a
 * `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` — generated locally, never taken from a feed,
 * and not the publisher's guid, which is a string somebody else wrote. That
 * was traced through the sync and the Google Reader client before the guard
 * was added, and it held.
 *
 * The guard exists because the invariant lived in a different file from the
 * code depending on it, which is the arrangement that stops being true without
 * anyone noticing. An id containing `../` would put an article's text into the
 * databases directory or over the shared preferences.
