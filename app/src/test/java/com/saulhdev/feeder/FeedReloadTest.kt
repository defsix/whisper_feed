/**
 * The feed reloads after a burst of table changes, not during one.
 *
 * A Room Flow query re-runs on every write to any table it names, and the feed
 * names Article and Feeds — both of which a sync writes to continuously.
 * Measured on a device: thirty a second while sources were being added, each
 * rebuilding five hundred whole article rows including full article text,
 * against a 256MB heap.
 *
 * A 300ms debounce was already downstream and was not helping, because a
 * debounce drops a value it has already been handed: the query had run and
 * built its rows before anything could decide they were unwanted. 151
 * emissions in one five-second window, 25 of them used.
 *
 * Two things have to stay true for the replacement to be honest, and neither
 * is visible by reading one file:
 *
 *  - the debounce is on the *signal*, never back on the result;
 *  - each one-shot query returns exactly what its Flow original did, because
 *    a "tidied" copy is a second, quietly different feed.
