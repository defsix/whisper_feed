/**
 * Leaving the feed does not mark its sources as broken.
 *
 * The per-feed sync caught `Throwable`, which includes
 * `CancellationException` — so closing the launcher panel mid-sync recorded a
 * failure against every feed still in flight. Three of those and a publisher
 * crosses the threshold into "Feeds that stopped working", accused of being
 * broken because the reader swiped away. A device report showed five sources
 * newly failing with "Job was cancelled" as the only reason in the log.
 *
 * Swallowing it is the other half of the same mistake: cancellation has to
 * propagate, or the coroutine that was cancelled carries on.
