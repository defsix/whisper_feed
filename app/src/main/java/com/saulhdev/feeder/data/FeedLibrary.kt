 * Whisper can already add a feed by address, import OPML, read a browser's
 * bookmarks and notice what the reader's own articles link to. What it could
 * not do was answer "what is there?" for somebody who does not already know —
 * which is the question a reader has on their first day and never again.
 *
 * **Bundled, not fetched, and for the same reason the starter list is.** A
 * directory served over the network would mean the app asking somewhere what
 * feeds exist, and a query like "photography" or "local politics" says quite a
 * lot about a person. The privacy notice lists exactly one developer-initiated
 * third-party call, and a feed catalogue is not worth making it two.
 *
 * The contents come from plenaryapp/awesome-rss-feeds, which is CC0 — public
 * domain, no attribution required, no licence friction with GPL-3.0. Every
 * address was fetched and parsed before it shipped, and the ones that no
 * longer serve a feed were dropped rather than passed on; see
 * docs/FEED_LIBRARY.md for what that removed and what it could not check.
