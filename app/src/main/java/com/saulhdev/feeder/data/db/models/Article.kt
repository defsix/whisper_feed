     * **Accumulated in ticks, never as a subtraction.** Nothing anywhere
     * stores "opened at X" and works out `now - X` on the way back, because
     * there is no guarantee of a way back: the reader can close the app, lock

     * three-day read. Counting forward in bounded steps that only happen while
     * somebody is looking makes that arithmetic impossible to express rather
     * than merely unlikely.
     *
     * Capped as well, for the case the ticks are honest about: a phone left
     * unlocked on a desk with an article open is awake, is resumed, and is not
     * being read.
     *
     * Two clocks write here. In the app, time is ticked while the article is
     * on screen. For an article opened in an external browser there is no
     * lifecycle to tick against, so the measurement is how long Whisper was
     * away, which is coarser and is thrown away entirely above a limit rather
     * than trusted — see `BrowserReadTimer`.
     *
     * Zero therefore does not mean "not read". It means nothing was measured,
     * and the weighting treats it as "opened, nothing further known" rather
     * than as evidence against the article.
