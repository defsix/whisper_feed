     * 300ms, but a debounce discards the list after it has been built, so the
     * cost was paid every time and thrown away most times.
     *
     * A diagnostics report put a number on it: 100–200MB collected per cycle
     * on a 256MB heap, a cycle every six to eight seconds, for the length of
     * the scroll, with threads blocking on the allocations in between.
     *
     * So the increments accumulate here and go out together. One transaction
     * is one invalidation however many rows it carries, which turns a scroll's
     * worth of re-queries into one every [DWELL_FLUSH_MS]. What is written is
     * identical — the same articles, the same milliseconds, the same cap
     * applied by the same SQL.
     *
     * The risk is bounded and named: up to [DWELL_FLUSH_MS] of dwell is lost
     * if the process dies mid-scroll. Dwell is a weighting signal built from
     * thousands of small observations, not something the reader typed, and
     * losing five seconds of it changes nothing they could notice. Anything
