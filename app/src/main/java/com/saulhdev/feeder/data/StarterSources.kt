/**
 * A few feeds to start with, so the first screen is not empty.
 *
 * Offered, never applied on its own: the reader sees exactly which ones they
 * are getting and can take any of them off before agreeing. That matters more
 * here than it would in most apps, because the screen this appears on says
 * "no algorithm decides what you see" — subscribing somebody silently on the
 * same screen would make that a lie.
 *
 * Nothing marks these as built in. Once subscribed they are ordinary sources,
 * indistinguishable from ones the reader added, and removed exactly the same
 * way. A "starter" flag would only exist to stop somebody deleting a feed they
 * did not choose, which is the opposite of the point.
 *
 * **Bundled rather than fetched.** A list downloaded on first launch would
 * mean the app phoning home before the reader has done anything, which is not
 * a promise worth breaking to save an app update.
 *
 * Every address here was checked against the live endpoint before it shipped.
