/**
 * Every preference's current value, in memory, so reading one costs nothing.
 *
 * `getValue()` used to be `runBlocking(Dispatchers.IO) { flow.first() }` at
 * every one of its fifty-odd call sites. That is not fifty disk reads —
 * DataStore keeps the loaded file in memory and serves later collections from
 * it — but it is fifty occasions on which a thread stops dead until a
 * coroutine dispatched to the IO pool comes back. On the main thread that is
 * the shape of an ANR: not slow in the normal case, and arbitrarily slow on
 * the one occasion the IO pool is busy, which for this app is during a sync,
 * which is exactly when somebody is looking at the screen.
 *
 * One collector keeps this snapshot current. Reads take the volatile
 * reference, so they are a field load and a map lookup, on any thread, with no
 * dispatch and nothing to wait for.
 *
 * The blocking path stays for the window before the first value arrives — see
 * [prime], which closes that window at startup — because returning a default
 * that is not the reader's setting is worse than a pause nobody will see.
