 *   alone here - removals from the server are never applied, because a partial
 *   answer or the wrong account would take somebody's feeds - or is new here,
 *   and goes to the server.
 *
 * The first sync has no memory, so everything each side lacks goes across:
 * signing in on a phone that already has a hundred feeds puts them on the
 * server, with no OPML file to carry by hand.

/**
 * Which server feed is which Whisper feed, when their addresses differ.
 *
 * A server keeps a feed under the address it settled on - after redirects,
 * with its own idea of the canonical form - and that is often not the one
 * Whisper was given. Compared by address alone, the first sync against a
 * server that already had the reader's feeds took 29 of them for new ones on
 * each side: copied down to Whisper, and sent up to the server, twice over.
 *
 * So, in order: the same address; a pairing remembered from an earlier sync
 * ([aliases]); then the same title, one to one, which is what both sides take
 * from the feed itself. A pairing found by title is returned in
 * [FeedMatch.newAliases] to be remembered, so a rename later does not undo it.
 * When several feeds share a title - a paper's sections are often all called
 * "The Guardian" - the one whose address ends the most alike is taken.
 *
 * What is left is new on its side. A feed is never left out for having the
 * same title as one already matched: that held back a second Guardian feed
 * from the server as a supposed copy, when it was a different section. Real
 * copies are for "Subscribed twice" to find, and removing one here then
 * removes it from the server too.
 *
 * @param local Whisper's feeds, key to title.
 * @param server the server's feeds, key to title.
