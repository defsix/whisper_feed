/**
 * How Whisper gets its articles, whether or not there is an account.
 *
 * The shape is taken from ReadYou's `AbstractRssRepository`, recorded in
 * `docs/REFERENCES.md` §2, and the important property is which method is
 * abstract: **only [sync] is.** Everything else has a working local
 * implementation here, and a remote provider overrides only what its service
 * actually supports.
 *
 * That is what keeps sync additive rather than a mode. [LocalRssService] is
 * not a null object standing in until a real one arrives — it is the real
 * default and the app is complete without ever having an account. A provider
 * adds replication to something that already works, and nothing above this
 * layer has to ask which case it is in.
 *
 * The alternative shape, a bare `pull()`/`push()` adapter, forces every caller
 * to know whether an adapter exists and what it can do, and puts the
 * local-only path on the error branch of code written for the remote one. That
 * is how local-first quietly becomes remote-first with an offline mode.
