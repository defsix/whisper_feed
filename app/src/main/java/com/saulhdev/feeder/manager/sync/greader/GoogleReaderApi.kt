/**
 * A client for the Google Reader API, as spoken by FreshRSS, Miniflux,
 * Inoreader and BazQux.
 *
 * Google's own Reader has been gone since 2013; what survived is its HTTP
 * interface, which those services implement because everything already spoke
 * it. One client therefore buys several services, needs no Google account and
 * no Play Services, and works against something a reader runs themselves.
 * `docs/REFERENCES.md` §2 records why this rather than Feedly, whose API turned
 * out to be enterprise-gated.
 *
 * The protocol is old and shows it. Authentication is a form post that returns
 * a token in a `key=value` body rather than JSON; writes need a *second*,
 * short-lived token fetched separately; and identifiers come in three shapes
 * (see [GoogleReaderIds]). None of that is avoidable, so it is all handled
 * here and nowhere else.
 *
 * This class does the protocol and nothing else: no database, no reconciling,
 * no decisions about what a sync means. That belongs above it.
