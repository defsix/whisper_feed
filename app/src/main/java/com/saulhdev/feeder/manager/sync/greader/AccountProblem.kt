/**
 * Why connecting to a sync server did not work, as something to say about it.
 *
 * The account screen used to show whatever the exception said. That is true
 * and useless: "Trust anchor for certification path not found" is a sentence
 * about a Java class hierarchy, offered to somebody who wanted their feeds. It
 * named neither what was wrong nor what to do, and the four most likely causes
 * — a typo, a wrong path, a wrong password, a certificate the phone will not
 * accept — were indistinguishable from one another and from a server being
 * down.
 *
 * An enum rather than a string, and it lives here rather than in the UI,
 * because [GoogleReaderApi] does the protocol and nothing else — including no
 * deciding how to word things. The wording, and its translations, belong to
 * the screen.
