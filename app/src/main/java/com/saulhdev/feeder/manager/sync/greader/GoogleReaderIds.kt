/**
 * The Google Reader protocol's identifiers, which are three shapes of the same
 * thing and the usual source of bugs in a client.
 *
 * An item arrives as a long form in stream contents:
 *
 *     tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/00000000cafebabe
 *
 * and as a short decimal in the ids endpoint:
 *
 *     3405691582
 *
 * They are the same item. The hex is sixteen digits, unsigned, and larger than
 * `Long.MAX_VALUE` for half the range — parsing it with `toLong()` throws on
 * exactly the ids whose top bit is set, which is why a naive client works for
 * months and then falls over on one article. `toULong(16).toLong()` keeps the
 * bit pattern, which is what the protocol means, and the decimal form is the
 * same number printed signed.
 *
 * Streams, tags and feeds have their own prefixes, and the protocol is
 * inconsistent about when a feed id includes the `feed/` prefix, so it is
 * added and stripped in exactly one place: here.
