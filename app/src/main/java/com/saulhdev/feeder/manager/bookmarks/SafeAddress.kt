 * feeds are *stored* with an http address, from before their site moved, and
 * their server has answered a redirect to https ever since. Nobody noticed
 * because the redirect did the work.
 *
 * Refusing the connection means that redirect never arrives, so those feeds
 * stopped fetching and appeared as broken — not because the publisher had
 * done anything, but because of the scheme written down years ago. Three of
 * them were visible in a single screen of one test device's source list.
 *
 * So the scheme is rewritten before the connection is attempted: an
 * application interceptor, not a network one, because by the time a network
 * interceptor runs the socket it would have to prevent is already being
 * opened.
 *
 * Nothing is weakened. No plaintext request is made either way; the only
 * change is that a host willing to serve https gets asked. A host that truly
 * only speaks http still fails, and should — that is the decision the audit
 * made, and this does not reverse it.
 *
 * The stored address is left alone. It is what the reader typed or imported,
 * the fetch works regardless, and rewriting somebody's subscription list as a
 * side effect of a network policy is not this interceptor's business.

 *
 * Refusing it breaks the thing the feature is for. Self-hosted FreshRSS and
 * Miniflux are the whole use case — the network security config says so in as
 * many words — and they live at `192.168.1.50`, at `nas.local`, and behind
 * Tailscale on `100.64/10`, all of which are refused. Guarding this client
 * protects nobody from anything and unsupports self-hosting, which is a poor
 * trade for a reader who went to the trouble of running their own server.
