/**
 * The reader's answer to Android's own backup, asked before anything is sent.
 *
 * `allowBackup` is a manifest attribute read by the system at install time and
 * there is no API to change it — `BackupManager` can request a backup pass but
 * cannot enable or disable one. So a settings switch cannot turn the platform
 * backup on and off directly. What it *can* do is decide what the app hands
 * over when the system asks, which is what this is: the system starts a backup,
 * this agent looks at what the reader chose, and writes nothing if they have
 * not asked for it.
 *
 * **The two routes are separate questions and get separate answers.** A
 * device-to-device transfer is a direct copy to the reader's next phone with
 * no server anywhere in it. A cloud backup puts the same data in Google's
 * hands. Somebody can quite reasonably want the first and not the second, and
 * `getTransportFlags()` says which one is running, so they are asked twice
 * rather than once.
 *
 * Both are off until turned on. A default that uploads somebody's reading
 * history before they have opened the app is not a choice they made.
