/**
 * Keeping a copy of the subscription list somewhere that is not this phone.
 *
 * **Through the Storage Access Framework, not the Google Drive API**, and the
 * difference is worth the paragraph. Talking to Drive directly means an OAuth
 * client registered against this app's package and signing certificate, which
 * is a step the project cannot take for its users and which would have to be
 * repeated for the debug build, the release build, and anyone forking this.
 * Picking a folder needs none of that: Drive ships a `DocumentsProvider`, the
 * system's own picker offers it alongside everything else, and a persistable
 * permission means the app can keep writing there afterwards without asking
 * again.
 *
 * It is also simply better. Dropbox, OneDrive, Nextcloud and an SD card all
 * appear in the same picker, so this is not a Google feature that happens to
 * be spelled generically — it works with wherever the reader already keeps
 * things. And there is no Google dependency to declare, which matters for a
 * build that goes to F-Droid.
 *
 * What it writes is exactly what the existing export writes: the same OPML,
 * from the same code. This is a destination, not a second format.
