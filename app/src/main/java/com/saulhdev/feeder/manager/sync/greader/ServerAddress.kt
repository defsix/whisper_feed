/**
 * The address to sign in to, from whatever the reader typed.
 *
 * Every other client in this app rewrites `http` to `https` on its way to the
 * socket, and this one deliberately does not. Not because upgrading a
 * credentialed address is dangerous — it is the same host either way, checked
 * against the system trust store, so nobody without a real certificate for
 * that name can be on the other end — but because a password is the wrong
 * thing to be quietly routed somewhere the reader did not agree to. They
 * should see what happened.
 *
 * So the correction is made here instead: at sign-in, in the field, before the
 * password is sent. The reader watches `http://` become `https://` and the
 * stored address is the corrected one, so it is right the next time too.
 *
 * Doing nothing was not an option worth keeping. Cleartext is refused at the
 * platform level, so an `http://` address never connects at all — it fails
 * with a network error that says nothing about the scheme, and the reader is
 * left to guess between a typo, a firewall, and a server that is down.
 *
 * A missing scheme is filled in for the same reason. `freshrss.example.com/…`
 * is what people paste out of their own browser's address bar.
