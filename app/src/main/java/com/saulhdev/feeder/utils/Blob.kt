/**
 * The characters an article's id may contain.
 *
 * Every id is a `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` — generated locally, never
 * taken from a feed, and not the publisher's guid, which is a string somebody
 * else wrote. That was traced through the sync and the Google Reader client
 * before this was added, and it holds today.
 *
 * It is enforced anyway, because the file name is built by interpolation and
 * nothing at that line said the id was safe to interpolate. An id containing
 * `../` would put an article's cached text outside `filesDir` — into the
 * databases directory, or over the shared preferences — and the invariant
 * that prevents it lives in a different file from the code that depends on
 * it. That is exactly the arrangement that stops being true without anyone
 * noticing.
 *
 * Hyphens and word characters cover a UUID with room to spare. Anything else
 * is a mistake worth hearing about rather than a case worth handling.
