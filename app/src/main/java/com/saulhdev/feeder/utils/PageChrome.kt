/**
 * Takes the page's own furniture out before the article is extracted.
 *
 * Readability keeps more than the article, and what it keeps most reliably is
 * the byline block. Run over six real articles, the leftovers were:
 *
 * - How-To Geek: the author's 90px avatar, then six paragraphs of his biography
 *   ("Ever since he got his first smartphone, the legendary Nokia 6600...")
 *   before the article's first sentence;
 * - The Verge: the author card - photograph, name, "Posts from this author
 *   will be added to your daily email digest" - and five topic-follow widgets
 *   saying the same about Gaming, Microsoft, News, Tech and Xbox.
 *
 * Every one of those duplicates something the reader already shows - the
 * author and the date are in its own header - or is a control that does
 * nothing here. It has to happen *before* extraction because extraction is
 * what forgets which element was which: the extracted HTML keeps no class
 * names, and a byline paragraph is a paragraph like any other once it has been
 * through. In the page they are labelled plainly - `w-author`,
 * `article-header-author-img`, `duet--article--article-byline`.
 *
 * Two rules, both general and both about what an element says it is:
 *
 * - **`<aside>`** goes. It is the element for content tangential to the page:
 *   The Verge's follow popovers are asides, and so are most sites' pull
 *   quotes, which repeat a sentence of the article in larger type - a
 *   duplicate by design. Mozilla's own Readability drops them for the same
 *   reason; the port this app uses does not.
 * - **Anything whose class or id names it an author or byline block** goes,
 *   as long as it is not most of the page. The guard matters: a theme that
 *   tags the whole article `author-jane` must lose its label, not its
 *   article.
 * - **Anything marked `data-nosnippet`** goes, under the same guard. It is
 *   Google's attribute for "this text is not the article; do not quote it in
 *   search results", and publishers put it on precisely this furniture.
 *   How-To Geek's six-paragraph author biography carries no author label at
 *   all - it sits in `div.with-excerpt` - but it is marked `data-nosnippet`,
 *   and so is its byline. A few sites mark whole paywalled sections the same
 *   way, which is what the size guard is for.
 *
 * Only new fetches benefit: an article whose full text is already cached was
 * extracted before this existed, and stays as it was until it is fetched
 * again.
