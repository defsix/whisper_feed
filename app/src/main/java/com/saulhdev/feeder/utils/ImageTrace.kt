/**
 * Times image decodes and records what format they were.
 *
 * A scroll's logcat showed six `c2.android.av1-dav1d.decoder` instances being
 * created — a full MediaCodec each, with its own native buffer pools. Nothing
 * in this app plays video. They are AVIF images: Android decodes AVIF and HEIF
 * through MediaCodec rather than through the ordinary bitmap path, so a
 * publisher serving AVIF silently turns each picture into a codec
 * instantiation.
 *
 * Worse than it first looks, and the codec's name is the reason. `c2.android.*`
 * are the AOSP *software* codecs; a hardware AV1 decoder would carry the
 * vendor's prefix. So these frames are being decoded on the CPU, one image at
 * a time, on a phone that has a hardware decoder it is not being handed.
 *
 * Which leaves a question worth answering before anything is changed: whether
 * it costs enough to matter. The obvious remedy is to stop advertising AVIF in
 * the Accept header, so a content-negotiating CDN sends WebP or JPEG instead —
 * but that trades a smaller download for a cheaper decode, and which way that
 * trade falls depends on numbers nobody has yet. Six decoder instantiations in
 * a minute might be forty milliseconds each or four.
 *
 * So this measures it: how many images were served, where from, how many
 * needed decoding at all, and how long each format took. The cache figures
 * come along for free and answer the other open question — whether the memory
 * cache is big enough, or whether scrolling back re-decodes everything.
 *
 * One instance per request, which is what makes the timing simple: the start
 * time is an ordinary field rather than an entry in a map that has to be
 * cleaned up on every path a request can fail down.
 *
 * **Formats and durations only, never addresses.** A URL names a publisher and
 * often an article; these lines go into a file the reader sends to a stranger.
 * The mime type is the whole of what is needed.
