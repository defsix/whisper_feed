/**
 * The last few syncs: what started each one, when, how it ended, and what the
 * phone was doing when it began.
 *
 * Every sync used to look the same afterwards. The report could show that
 * sources had synced at 06:41 and 08:07, but not whether the schedule, the
 * panel or a pull to refresh had started it - and that was the whole question
 * when testing a switch that is meant to stop two of the three. Each request
 * now carries its [origin][ORIGIN_KEY], and the worker writes a line here as
 * it starts and again as it ends.
 *
 * Kept in its own small preferences file, so it survives the process being
 * killed overnight, which is when the scheduled syncs happen. Nothing in it
 * names a source or an address: origin, times, outcome, plugged in or not,
 * network kind.
