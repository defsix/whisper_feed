 * feeds in separate groups rather than merging unrelated ones. That is the
 * safe direction for a screen whose whole job is to suggest candidates.

 * alias is the commonest way to end up subscribed to one publication twice.

 * Europe feeds share a domain and are three different things; so do NPR's
 * topic feeds. Anything built on this has to show the groups and let the
 * reader decide, never act on them — which is exactly why this is separate
 * from [normalizeFeedUrl], where a match means the same address and can be
 * trusted.
