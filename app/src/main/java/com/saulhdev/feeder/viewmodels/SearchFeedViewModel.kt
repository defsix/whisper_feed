    /**
     * Turns whatever the user typed into feeds they can subscribe to.
     *
     * Three stages, and the order is the point. Whatever was typed is tried
     * first, because most of the time it is already a feed. Then the site's own
     * `<link rel="alternate">` declarations, which are the site telling us the
     * answer. Only then the conventional paths — `/feed`, `/rss.xml` and the
     * rest — because that stage is guessing, and on a site that advertises its
     * feed properly a guess can land on something worse: a `/feed` that
     * redirects to the homepage, or a partial feed where the declared one is
     * complete.
     *
     * Probing stops as soon as a stage finds anything, so pasting a working
     * feed URL costs one request and `howtogeek.com` costs two. Only a site
     * with no feed declaration at all pays for the path probing, and even then
     * it stops at the first path that parses.
     *
     * Results are emitted as they are found rather than collected at the end,
     * so the first feed appears while the rest are still being checked.
