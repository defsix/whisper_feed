 * an OPML export hands the old address to whatever reader imports it next,
 * and the upgrade only holds for requests that go through the clients carrying
 * that interceptor. Fixing the stored address fixes all three at once and
 * makes the interceptor a safety net rather than the mechanism.
 *
 * **Every address is checked before it is changed.** A blind rewrite would
 * cost nothing today — an http-only feed already fails, because Android is
 * told to refuse cleartext — but it would write an address that does not work
 * into the database and then into every export. An address that is wrong and
 * confident is worse than one that is right about being broken.
