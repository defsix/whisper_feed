 * alone rather than only after opening what the button opens.
 *
 * Shared between the launcher overlay and the app because the two headers
 * carry the same three actions, and they had drifted: the app drew its
 * bookmarks toggle as a Surface with its own padding while everything beside
 * it was an IconButton, so the row was subtly unevenly spaced — the sizes
 * differed, and only one of the three had a touch target the platform
 * considers large enough.
