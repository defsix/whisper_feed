/**
 * The shape scale, as the theme's third axis alongside colour and type.
 *
 * MaterialTheme was only ever given a colour scheme and a typography, so
 * `MaterialTheme.shapes` sat at the Material default while the components that
 * needed a corner each picked their own number — 24dp here, 20dp there, 16dp,
 * 14dp, 12dp. Corner radius is part of what makes a surface look Material You
 * rather than generic, and scattering it meant the app could not be made
 * rounder or squarer without hunting through files.
 *
 * The steps follow Material 3's roles and are one notch rounder than its
 * defaults (4/8/12/16/28), which is what Material You's own surfaces look like
 * on a Pixel. Everything that draws a corner now names a role here rather than
 * a number, so the whole app's shape language moves from this one place.
