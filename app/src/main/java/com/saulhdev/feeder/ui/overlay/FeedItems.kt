/**
 * The feed, as a list of cards.
 *
 * This replaces `heldFeed`, which put a clustered story into a `stickyHeader`
 * so it stayed at the top for the next few articles. That is gone, and the
 * reasoning is worth keeping because the feature sounded right.
 *
 * Its condition was positional, not editorial:
 *
 *     val first = articles.firstOrNull() ?: return null
 *     val isLead = clusters[first.id]?.leadId == first.id
 *     if (isLead) first else null
 *
 * It held whatever happened to be first in the list *currently on screen*, if
 * that item led any cluster. In a search, "first in the list" means the first
 * result for whatever was typed; in a category, the first of that category;
 * and the same would have applied to a single-source view. None of those has
 * anything to do with a story breaking, so the hold fired in places where the
 * thing it claimed to be doing was meaningless — and a reader who had searched
 * for something got a card stuck over their results.
 *
 * It was also expensive to keep upright. A `stickyHeader` is drawn *over* the
 * list rather than in it, so every part of the card had to be opaque or it
 * became a window onto the articles sliding underneath; that was fixed twice,
 * and a held card with no image was see-through still. The read-dimming had to
 * learn an exemption for it. It needed a Dismiss action, because being
 * unavoidable is the one thing it was good at.
 *
 * What it was for survives, and was already on the card before any of this:
 * `CoverageLine` draws a megaphone and the number of sources carrying the
 * story, on the card, in its ordinary place in the feed. The clustering that
 * works that out is untouched — it still decides emphasis, still explains
 * itself in the weighting reasons, and a dismissal still gives back the
 * promotion. Only the sticking is gone.
