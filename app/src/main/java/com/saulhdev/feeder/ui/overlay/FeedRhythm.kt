/**
 * Picks a shape for the article at [index], for the chosen [layout].
 *
 * The four layouts differ in what they are *for*, not in decoration:
 *
 *  - **Cards** varies the weight of consecutive items. A feed of identical
 *    cards reads as one undifferentiated column and gives the eye nothing to
 *    catch on, which is the thing a scrolling news surface most has to avoid.
 *    A hero opens, another lands every eighth item to reset the rhythm, a full
 *    card sits at a regular offset between, compact rows fill the rest.
 *  - **Magazine** commits to the image on every item. Fewer articles per
 *    screen, each one worth stopping at — for reading rather than triage.
 *  - **List** drops images entirely. Most articles per screen, for getting
 *    through a backlog.
 *  - **Mosaic** is a staggered grid of three tile sizes, the largest crossing
 *    both columns. Leaving the variation to the images' own aspect ratios was
 *    not enough in practice: news photography is overwhelmingly 16:9, so every
 *    tile came out the same height and the grid read as a table. Which article
 *    gets which size is the one thing here that is not positional — see
 *    FeedWeight.kt.
 *
 * The Cards pattern is positional rather than content-derived on purpose.
 * Deriving it from the article — image size, title length, source — would make
 * the layout jump around as a sync reorders the list, and an article would
 * change shape depending on what happened to load near it.
 *
 * In every layout except List, an article with no usable image falls back to a
 * shape that does not need one: the image-led shapes collapse into an oddly
 * padded blank without one.
