/**
 * The category strip beneath the feed header.
 *
 * Selection maps onto the existing tag filter, so choosing a chip filters the
 * feed through the same path the filter sheet already uses. Selecting none is
 * "All": an empty tag set is what the article query treats as unfiltered.
 *
 * The "All" chip is always drawn, even with no categories to sit beside it.
 * That is partly so the row is visibly present before any source has been
 * tagged, and partly because an empty row is indistinguishable from one that
 * failed to render — which is precisely what made the first version of this
 * hard to verify on device.
 *
 * The permanent categories the design calls for (Unread, Saved, Recently
 * Added) are not here yet: articles currently carry no read state at all, so
 * they need the article-state model rather than a chip that lies.
 *
 * Unselected chips carry a filled container rather than Material's default
 * outline-over-nothing. The overlay's background opacity is user-adjustable, and
 * at a low setting an outlined chip has nothing behind it but the wallpaper —
 * the labels became unreadable on anything busy. A container costs a little of
 * the "unselected" contrast against the selected chip and buys legibility that
 * does not depend on what the user's wallpaper happens to be.
