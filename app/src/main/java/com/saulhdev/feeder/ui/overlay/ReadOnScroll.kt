/**
 * Marks an article read once it has been on screen long enough.
 *
 * Time on screen rather than scroll speed. A fling past forty headlines is
 * plainly not reading, but velocity is the wrong way to detect it: it swings
 * inside a single fling, so the same gesture would mark some cards and not
 * others depending on where in the deceleration curve they landed. How long a
 * card was actually visible asks the question directly.
 *
 * The threshold is the reader's to set, because the honest answer is that
 * there is no right number — it depends on how fast someone reads and how they
 * scroll. Off by default: this is a surface people scroll idly and come back
 * to, not an inbox.
 *
 * **Time on screen is the qualifier, not the trigger.** An earlier version
 * marked an article the moment its clock ran out, which meant it faded out
 * while it was being read — the reader watching a card grey out under their
 * eyes, mid-sentence, because they had been looking at it too long. That is
 * the exact opposite of what the setting is for.
 *
 * So the mark happens when the article has been *passed*: it earned its dwell,
 * and then scrolled off the top of the screen. Leaving upwards is the part
 * that matters and is why this counts indices rather than pixels — an article
 * that leaves through the bottom edge was scrolled back away from, not read
 * past, and keeps the dwell it earned for when the reader comes back down.
 *
 * The consequence is deliberate: an article read carefully and left on screen
 * is never marked, and the last article in the list cannot be marked at all,
 * because neither has been passed. Both are correct. Nothing dims while it is
 * being looked at.
 *
 * **The clock only runs while someone is looking.** [LaunchedEffect] is not
 * lifecycle-aware, so until this was gated the tick loop kept running with the
 * phone in a pocket: whatever happened to be on screen when the app was left
 * accrued dwell, crossed the threshold, and was marked read by the next scroll.
 * Time the reader was not present is not time spent reading, so the loop is
 * held below RESUMED and, in the overlay, while the panel is shut — see
 * [LocalFeedVisible] for why one gate cannot do both.
